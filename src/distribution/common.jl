function rescale(dist::AbstractVector, alpha=1.5)

    rescale the dist array to avoid overreacting to atypically large number.
    There are three steps:
    1. dist will be first normalize to [0, 1].
    2. Then the values that are close to 1.0 will not be changed much, while that close to zero will be amplified to a value controlled by alpha.
    3. In the end, the rescaled dist array will be normalized to [0, 1].
